 * The strict decoder is total and refuses hostile bytes with structured
 * codes; that law is untouched. What this contract adds is a second chance
 * for files whose STRUCTURE is sound but whose NOTE STREAM carries the
 * defects real exports produce (a re-struck note that never ended, an
 * orphan note-off, a note left sounding at end of track). The salvage pass
 * rewrites the raw bytes with the least-disruptive musical repair for each
 * defect, then feeds the repaired bytes through the SAME strict decoder —
 * so every structural guarantee, limit, and naming law still comes from
 * the one reviewed reader, and a repaired read is stated honestly rather
 * than passed off as the file's own content.
